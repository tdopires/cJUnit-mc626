/**
 * Minimalistic helper class to implement a cyclic barrier for concurrent
 * unit tests.
 * <p>
 * The goal is to provide a very simple synchronization aid that allows all
 * threads of a concurrent test case to wait for each other to reach a
 * common barrier point.  No initialization, no resets, no interruptions, no
 * <code>try { await() } catch (InterruptedException) {}</code> blocks or
 * <code>throws InterruptedException</code> declarations.
 * <p>
 * It is automatically initialized to wait for all threads in a concurrent
 * test case.  Can only be used in concurrent test cases with the
 * <code>threadCount</code> or <code>threadGroup</code> annotations.
