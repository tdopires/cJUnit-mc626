/**
 * The <code>ConcurrentTest</code> annotation tells cJUnit that the
 * <code>public void</code> method to which it is attached can be run as a
 * concurrent test case.  To check that the test method delivers the correct
 * results regardless of the scheduling of its threads, the test method is
 * executed in all possible thread interleavings.  Any exceptions thrown by
 * the test in any of the thread interleavings will be reported as failure.
 * If no exceptions are thrown in any thread interleavings, the test is
 * assumed to have succeeded.
 * <p>
 * The <code>ConcurrentTest</code> annotation supports three optional
 * parameters: <code>expected</code>, <code>threadCount</code>, and
 * <code>threadGroup</code>.
 * <p>
 * The first optional parameter, <code>expected</code>, declares that a test
 * method should throw an exception in all thread interleavings.  If it
 * doesn't throw an exception or if it throws a different exception than the
 * one declared in any of the thread interleavings, the test fails.  The
 * <code>expected</code> annotation parameter can be combined with the
 * <code>threadCount</code> or <code>threadGroup</code> parameters.  When
 * combined with <code>threadCount</code>, the test method must throw
 * the declared exception in all threads, in all thread interleavings.  When
 * combined with <code>threadGroup</code>, each test method in the
 * group must throw its declared exception in all thread interleavings.
 * <p>
 * The second optional parameter, <code>threadCount</code>, specifies the
 * number of threads that will concurrently invoke the test method.  cJUnit
 * will automatically create the necessary number of threads and will invoke
 * the test method from all of them.  For example the following test case
 * <pre>
 *   int i = 0;
 *   &#064;ConcurrentTest(threadCount=2)
 *   public void incrementByTwoThreads() {
 *       synchronized (lock) { i++; }
 *       TestBarrier.await();
 *       assertThat(i, equalTo(2));
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * involves two threads, both of them concurrently invoking the
 * <code>incrementByTwoThreads()</code> method.  The
 * <code>threadCount</code> and <code>expected</code> annotation parameters
 * can be combined.  In this case the test method must throw the declared
 * exception in all threads in all thread interleavings to make the test
 * succeed.
 * <p>
 * The third optional parameter, <code>threadGroup</code>, allows to group
 * multiple test methods into a single concurrent unit test.  The integer
 * argument of the <code>threadGroup</code> annotation parameter specifies
 * the ID of the group the test method belongs to.  Test methods belonging
 * to the same group are part of a single concurrent unit test and will be
 * invoked from different threads concurrently.  cJUnit will automatically
 * create the necessary number of threads and will invoke the test methods
 * from those threads.
 * <pre>
 *   final int exampleTGID=42;
 *   int i = 0;
 *   &#064;ConcurrentTest(threadGroup=exampleTGID)
 *   public void incrementAndVerify() {
 *       synchronized (lock) { i++; }
 *       TestBarrier.await();
 *       assertThat(i, equalTo(0));
 *   }
 *   &#064;ConcurrentTest(threadGroup=exampleTGID)
 *   public void decrement() {
 *       synchronized (lock) { i--; }
 *       TestBarrier.await();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * In this example both test methods have the same thread group id (42),
 * therefore they are part of the same concurrent unit test.  Two threads
 * will be created, one of which invokes <code>incrementAndVerify()</code>,
 * while the other invokes the <code>decrement()</code> method.  The
 * <code>threadGroup</code> and <code>expected</code> annotation parameters
 * can be combined.  Each test method must throw the exception declared by
 * its <code>expected</code> annotation parameter in all thread
 * interleavings to make the test succeed.  Test methods of the same
 * concurrent unit test might specify different expected exceptions.
 * <p>
 * The <code>threadCount</code> and <code>threadGroup</code> annotation
 * parameters are mutually exclusive.
